      <h2>Chicago Bulls</h2>
      <img src="media/bulls.png">
      <p>Known for their historic run in the 90s with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Dennis Rodman, the Chicago Bulls were considered the best basketball team ever assembled. Since then, they have done NOTHING to live up to the name. They have not won a championship since the Michael Jordan era, and have seemed to been cursed with injury prone point guards. To name a few, MVP Derrick Rose lost his spark from an ACL tear in 2012 and Lonzo Ball was told he will never play basketball again due ot another knee injury. It has been rough being a fan of the bulls in recent years, but we hope to rebuild in the future, successfully this time.</p>

      <h2>Chicago Baseball</h2>
      <img src="media/cubs.jpeg">
      <p>Chicago baseball before the 21st century was awful. The cubs were almost 100 years without a ring and the sox were not far behind. In the 2000s though, they both shockingly broke their droughts. Nobody thought the cubs were gonna win in their entire franchise's history ever again, but they did in 2016. The Sox also won in 2005, but since then it has been terrible for both teams. The cubs lost 15 of their last 21 games to miss the playoffs this year, and the White Sox were one of baseball's worst teams. Just Awful. </p>

      <h2>Da Bears.</h2>
      <img src="media/bears.jpeg">
      <p>Now, what we have all been waiting for, the Chicago Bears. There isn't much to say besides the fact that they are awful. They blew a 21 point lead to the second worst team in football, behind us of course, continue to ruin quarterbacks career, continue to not sign players, have no development, and the list just goes on. I have nothing else to say. If you live in chicago you know.</p>
