      <h2>1. The Distance of the Sun</h2> 
      <img src="media/sun.jpeg" alt="close up sun picture">
      <p>Say the sun were to implode on itself and immediately turn into a black hole. Instant chaos on earth, right?</p>
      <p>Wrong. The truth is, since the sun is so far away, it would take the light from the explosion around 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach earth. We wouldn't even know! And you may be thinking, "Well, we would hear it anyway". Wrong again! The sound would take even longer to reach us! I mean, it is 93 million miles away from us.</p>
      <h2>2. Spaghetti in Space???</h2>
      <img src="media/blackhole.jpeg" alt="black hole picture">
      <p> You're entering a black hole, and you imagine how your insides are going to be completely destroyed into mere molecules of matter as your consciousness fades. Terrifying right?</p>
      <p> The truth of the matter is, say you were to survive outside of the ship without oxygen or a suit, you would not be utterly destroyed within seconds. Really, you would watch the entire life of the universe go past you as your body is slowly stretched out by the gravity of the black whole. This process is called spaghettification, and occurs because as gravity becomes stronger, time dilation occurs. Time appears to go slower for you as it goes faster for everyone else. Beautiful, yet tragic to think about really. </p>
      <p> Below is a video showcasing what spaghettification would hypothetically look like.</p>
